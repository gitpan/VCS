NAME
    VCS - Library for generic Version Control System access in Perl

SYNOPSIS
        use VCS;
        $file = VCS::File->new($ARGV[0]);
        print $file->name, ":\n";
        for $version ($file->versions) {
            print
                $version->version,
                ' was checked in by ',
                $version->author,
                "\n",
                ;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    `VCS' is an API for abstracting access to all version control
    systems from Perl code. This is achieved in a similar fashion to
    the `DBI' suite of modules. There are "container" classes,
    `VCS::Dir', `VCS::File', and `VCS::Version', and
    "implementation" classes, such as `VCS::Cvs::Dir',
    `VCS::Cvs::File', and `VCS::Cvs::Version', which are subclasses
    of their respective "container" classes.

    `VCS' ships with `VCS::Rcs', `VCS::Cvs', and `VCS::Hms' implementation
    classes.  Others can be added.

METHODS
  VCS->implementations

    Returns a list of the implementations, in the order in which
    they will be tried by the container classes. The first time it
    is called (as determined by whether there are any
    implementations known), it will search @INC for all compliant
    implementations.

  VCS->add_implementations(@implementations)

    `@implementations' is moved/added to the front of the list, so
    use this also to set the default or control the order of
    implementations tried.

AVAILABILITY
    VCS.pm and its friends will be available from CPAN.
    There is also a Sourceforge project at:

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcs/

PREREQUISITE MODULES
    VCS.pm requires that Sort::Versions be installed.

    The optional vcsweb.cgi program uses the CGI and CGI::Carp modules.

CHANGES FROM 0.03
    Add Hms.
    Split out VCS_dev.pod documentation for VCS::* developers.

CHANGES FROM 0.02
    Documentation, mostly. Caching still doesn't work with
    long-lived processes.
