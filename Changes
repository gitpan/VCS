Revision history for Perl extension VCS.

	- VCS URLs, eliminating problems with which kind of VCS to use.
	- Exceptions on failed calls to "new" instead of returning undef. This
	  enables calling code to assume it "just worked", and also when it
	  fails, information is available (from the message) as to just what
	  went wrong.
	- An "init" method, callable by "new" in subclasses, cutting down on
	  redundant code in subclasses.
	- A "path" method to use instead of "name", which was potentially
	  ambiguous. The data for this is setup in "init", so subclasses
	  should not need to touch.
	- Because of the above, subclasses like e.g. VCS::X::Dir must inherit
	  from VCS::Dir. If they wish to inherit from VCS::X, they should set
	  @ISA to qw(VCS::X VCS::Dir).

        - [now in SourceForge CVS]
        - Added VCS::Hms
	- Added multitude of changes from Peter Prymmer:
        - modified the MANIFEST to include the various Hms*
          files as well as the new VCS_dev.pod doc and a Imp_pod.tpl
          file
	- added pod to VCS/Rcs.pm and similar pod to VCS/Hms.pm.
          He turned the generalization of pod into the Imp_pod.tpl pod
          template for other VCS::* developers to borrow from.
        - touched up other pod to render it `podchecker -warnings
          -warnings` using podchecker from a test installation of perl
          5.7.2 (perl@12494 kit from jhi). This mostly entailed
          s/\$object->method/\$object-E<gt>method/ in =head[12]
          headings. He added gratuitous =cut's to most pods (even
          though podchecker does not seem to mind their absence).
        - He turned one of the example programs into a MakeMaker
          extractable *.PL script.  Specifically he turned
          examples/diff-hist into examples/diff-hist.PL and made
          appropriate changes to the Makefile.PL. He has only touched
          the one program and wanted to solicit comment on this
          installation technique: note that by running `make install`
          the blib/scripts/diff-hist script will be installed into
          your @INC in such a way that `diff-hist` will lie in you
          $PATH.  Is this something worth doing with the other
          programs in the examples/* directory? Should the examples
          be given other more distinctive names such as vcsdiff-hist,
          i.e. with a leading 'vcs' name?

        - more documentation
	- a couple of bug fixes

        - lots of bugfixes and documentation
	  updates and clarifications
        - fixed bug in the caching which meant
	  that we got almost no hits
	- fixed bug which caused us to do nasty
	  things if VCS::Rcs saw any locked files
